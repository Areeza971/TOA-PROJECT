# TOA-PROJECT 
# DFA Minimization (C++)

This project implements a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) Minimization** algorithm using C++. It reduces the number of states in a DFA without changing the language it accepts.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Reads DFA from user input or file
- Performs state minimization using partitioning
- Outputs the minimized DFA
- Simple and clear C++ code
